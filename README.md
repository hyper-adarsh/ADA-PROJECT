# ADA-PROJECT

📌 Description

This project is based on Analysis and Design of Algorithms (ADA) and demonstrates the implementation of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms. It covers concepts of recursion, sorting, searching, stack, queue, linked list, Tower of Hanoi, and tree traversal methods. The aim is to understand algorithm design, efficiency, and practical applications.

✨ Features

📚 Comprehensive Coverage – Includes major DSA topics like recursion, sorting, searching, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and Tower of Hanoi.

🔄 Recursion Implementations – Demonstrates direct, indirect, tail, head, and tree recursion with practical examples.

🧮 Multiple Sorting Techniques – Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick sort implemented and analyzed.

🔍 Efficient Searching – Linear and Binary search algorithms for ordered and unordered data.

📦 Stack & Queue Operations – Push, Pop, Peek, Enqueue, and Dequeue with array and linked list implementations.

🔗 Dynamic Data Structures – Linked list implementation for flexible memory usage.

🏗 Tower of Hanoi – Classic recursive solution demonstrating divide and conquer.

🌳 Tree Traversals – Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversal methods for hierarchical data.

⚡ Performance Analysis – Time and space complexities evaluated for algorithms.

🖥 C Language Implementation – Simple, modular, and well-documented C programs.



⚙️ How It Works

1.Compilation & Execution

All programs are written in C language.

Each module (Recursion, Sorting, Searching, Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree Traversal, Tower of Hanoi) can be compiled and executed using a C compiler such as gcc.

2.User Interaction

firstly use will fill the user authentications and after that it move on to the topics one by one.

On running a program, the user provides input values (like array size, elements, or number of disks for Tower of Hanoi).

The program then applies the selected algorithm or data structure operation.

3.Algorithm Execution

Recursion: Functions call themselves until a base condition is met (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi).

Sorting: Elements are arranged using algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

Searching: User inputs an element to find, and the program applies Linear or Binary Search.

Stack/Queue: Operations like push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue are demonstrated.

Linked List: Nodes are dynamically created and manipulated (insert, delete, traverse).

Tree Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals display the tree structure.

4.Output

The result of the algorithm (sorted array, search result, recursion trace, stack/queue contents, linked list structure, or tree traversal order) is displayed on the console.

Time and space complexities can be discussed for performance evaluation.
