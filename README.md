# ADA-PROJECT

ðŸ“Œ Description

This project is based on Analysis and Design of Algorithms (ADA) and demonstrates the implementation of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms. It covers concepts of recursion, sorting, searching, stack, queue, linked list, Tower of Hanoi, and tree traversal methods. The aim is to understand algorithm design, efficiency, and practical applications.

ðŸ”‘ Topics Implemented

Recursion â€“ Direct, Indirect, Tail, Head, and Tree Recursion

Sorting Algorithms â€“ Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick

Searching Algorithms â€“ Linear Search, Binary Search

Stack and Queue â€“ Operations and applications

Linked List â€“ Insertion, Deletion, Traversal

Tower of Hanoi â€“ Recursive problem using divide and conquer

Tree Traversals â€“ Inorder, Preorder, Postorder

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome

This project provides hands-on experience with core algorithms, enhances problem-solving skills, and helps analyze time and space complexities for better algorithm design.
